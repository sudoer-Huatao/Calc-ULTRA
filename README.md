- Multifunctional, user-friendly Derivative Integral Calculator!
- No Python background knowledge needed.
- Supports derivatives, antiderivatives, and definite integrals - with a graph!
- (Please FULL SCREEN your console/terminal for better experience!)

Note on integral calculation: Due to limitations of the SymPy module, SOME FUNCTIONS CAN NOT BE INTEGRATED. The Error Function erf(x) is available to both types of integrals, but the Absolute Value and Factorial functions are only available to definite integral calculations and the factorial function cannot be graphed properly. Integration of composed functions are limited. While some composed functions work, others don't.
