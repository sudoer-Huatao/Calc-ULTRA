## Requirements

This program requires `sympy`,  `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `datetime`, `math`, `logging`, `warnings` and `os` modules. `datetime`, `math`, `logging`, `warnings` and `os` are built-in to most Python editors. The rest can be installed with the command `pip install MODULE_NAME`.

# Warnings!!!

## Error Message:

If your computer returns this error:

`PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/../Calc-ULTRA_Calculus-Calculator-main/texts/main_screen.txt'`

Please ensure that your current directory is the "Calc-ULTRA_Calculus-Calculator-main" folder, then run this command in the terminal to resolve the error:

`sudo python3 Calc-ULTRA.py`

This should resolve the issue. üòÖ

## Function limitations:

Due to limitations of the SymPy module, SOME FUNCTIONS CAN NOT BE INTEGRATED. The Error Function erf(x) can be integrated in both indefinite integral and definite integral calculation, but the Absolute Value and Factorial functions are only available to definite integral calculations. Also, the factorial function cannot be graphed properly. Integration of composed functions are also limited due to SymPy limitations. While some composed functions work, others don't. üòü
